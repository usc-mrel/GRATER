Code Structure
--------------



### scripts in main folder:
   1. **process_grater_data.m** <br />
      This script will adjust GRATER data for amplitude A, angle phi,
      off-resonance df, sub-sample time shift t0, and T2* decay. Choose
      expno = 1, 2, or 3 to process data for the uniform sphere, large 
      flip angle, or non-homogeneous volume experiments, respectively. <br />
   2. **process_reference_data.m** <br />
       This script will process raw refererence (pick-up coil) data.
       Choose expno = 1 or expno = 3 to process data for the uniform
       sphere or non-homogeneous volume experiments, respectively. <br />
   3. **run_exp2_sm_lg_FA.m** <br />
       Run this script to simulate GRATER for different flip angles in a
       single-band pulse (choose different RF envelopes by changing
       b1 vector, or play around with simuation parameters) <br />
   4. **plot_some_examples.m** <br />
       Run this script to see some examples of the reference, programmed,
       and GRATER waveforms.
   4. **plot_exp1_figs.m** <br />
       Run this script to generate figures 3 and 4 from the GRATER manuscript.
